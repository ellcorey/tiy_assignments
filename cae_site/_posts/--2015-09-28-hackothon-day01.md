##day 01

###the game
Every cohort at the Iron Yard goes through a group project known as a Hackothon â€” a "grueling" weekend+ long build project where the individual cohorts (UI design, front-end, back-end) are split up into teams. Each team usually consists of a combination of students from front-end development, back-end development, and UI design courses. While it appears each cohort varies in the way the teams are organized, the goal is the same: to create a functioning web app in less than 4 days.

###the players
For our cohort, the teams were picked behind closed doors by the instructors. Without being in the room, it's impossible to know what the selection process was for pairing students up. It is possible to take a logical crack at it, and I believe the concept was grouping similar personalities that would make the technical side easier while we climb the wall that working in a group presents.

My group consists of 1 UI designer (me, Corey), 1 back-end developer (Garret), and 2 front-end developers (Bob & Whitney). We've got a strong team with very diverse backgrounds but seemingly similar processes of completing our individual and group tasks. Additionally, our personalities seem to match pretty well.

###our idea
The idea we pitched was an online app that would allow creatives to find collaborators on music, film, and design related projects by searching a database of users who are looking to be found. The concept came from anecdotes of someone needing to fill a spot in a band quickly, find someone with particular gear or skills for filming, or even just getting into a new environment with like minded individuals.

The feedback we received post-pitch allowed us to focus on one aspect by removing the additional field[s] for film and design. This would prove to be excellent wisdom.

###the deliverables
As the UI Designer in our team, I had my own key deliverables in addition to the group.

group
-every member must be a contributor on our project repository with at least 5 commits
-use branching and pulling to effectively work on your master repository
-multi-device friendly (responsive)
-a polished representation

UI specific
-find 3 websites to inspire the design/layout/functionality of the app
-sketches for each page
-mockups for 1 page at two breakpoints
-3 Style Tiles
-build the HTML/Sass
-make design decisions that can be defended

The design students had so many deliverables that had to be handled prior to coding, so my goal was to get my site inspiration, sketches, and mockups completed before day 02. This didn't end up happening, but I was able to get feedback on my sketches and site inspirations before going home on the first evening.
