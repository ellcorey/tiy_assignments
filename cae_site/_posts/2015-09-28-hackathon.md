##UI design project

###the premise
Every cohort at the Iron Yard goes through a group project known as a Hackothon â€” a "grueling" weekend+ long build project where the individual cohorts (UI design, front-end, back-end) are split up into teams. Each team usually consists of a combination of students from front-end development, back-end development, and UI design courses. While each cohort varies in the way the teams are organized, the goal is the same: to create a functioning web app in less than 4 days. My cohort ran our Hackothon at the end of week 05.

###deliverables

####group
- every member must be a contributor on the project repository with at least 5 commits
- use branching and pulling to effectively work on project's master repository
- multi-device friendly (responsive)
- a polished representation

####UI specific
- find 3 websites to inspire the design/layout/functionality of the app
- sketches for each page
- mockups for 1 page at two breakpoints
- 3 style tiles
- build the HTML/Sass
- make design decisions that can be defended

###the app
SkillsUp is the working title for the web app my team built. The concept is a site dedicated to connecting creatives for collaboration. Initially we set out to offer the service to musicians, film makers, and designers, but scaled back to just musicians to avoid mission creep and an overload of work.

The completed project shows how effective 4 students (with only 5 weeks experience in web/database technologies) can be in an accelerated environment. Our app incorporates a multitude of current web & database technologies including html, css, scss, [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/), javascript, jquery, ruby, rails, and [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). Additionally, we used [GitHuh](https://github.com/) and terminal for our collaboration & version control, and [GitPages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting. You can see our repository [here](https://github.com/bobmccarthy/stop-drop-and-collaborate), and our page [here](http://bobmccarthy.github.io/).

###design overview

###site inspirations
Site inspirations are something we've used for almost every project thus far. For this project, I chose two sites whose core functionality is based around sharing things, and another that offered a very clean layout for a service offered. 

####[Air BnB](https://www.airbnb.com/)
Air BnB offers a great site with a clean layout and heavy use of images. The overlayed text doesnt' always lend itself to acceptable contrast and could be imrpoved upon. The app communicates the results, related map, and pertinent information effectively without feeling too claustrophobic.

####[Buddytruk](https://www.buddytruk.com/)
Buddytruk is a vehicle/driver service. The full length nature of their site gives a brief overview of the service along with user stories, and the process of using the app. The colors are bright and friendly, and there is effective use of white space to break up the sections.

####[Leap](http://leaptransit.com/)
Leap offers alternative bus options in the city of San Francisco. Leap's site has a vibe of community and comfort which, to me, makes me want to try out their service. Another site with a top to bottom, single page style, it also has a two column layout that I really enjoyed. It leads your eye down the page with large, bright images and doesn't break up the information housed in the right column.
