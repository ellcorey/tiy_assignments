##day 02

###where there's smoke, there's fire
Friday morning, we hit the ground running. Garret had worked on a large part of his database, Bob & Whitney were working on getting the front-end to talk to the back-end, and I had managed to finish up the majority of my style tiles at home, Thursday evening. Unfortunately, I had to bang out some mockups still and wasn't able to begin coding just yet.

Just before breaking for lunch, the back-end students were informed that their side of the project had to be posted to Heroku before 2P which forced us to move in a different direction with our data. In addition, we were forced to come up with a name for our app. Bob had come up with SkillsUp (a meetup for talented people), and that was the name we ended up using (names can change, right?).

###coding begins
At some point during the middle of day 02, I began coding by working on the main page. Beginning with the mobile size of the homepage was a directional choice that was somewhat out of my control. I'd have much rather began at the core of our app.

Whitney had laid out the basic html structure with Bob working on javascript and getting backbone up and running.
