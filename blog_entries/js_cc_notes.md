#Javascript Crash Course

##TIY chat app

###why?
a chat application that allows you to view recent messages and the total # of messages sent.

###notes
- functions
    + executable bits of code
    + penny machine analogy (any machine for that matter)
    + put anything into the function, run it, and receive an output
    + call [run] the function by it's name
    + can be run and listed throughout the javascript file


- variables
    + best practice is to scope variables as closely as possible
    + variables do not work outside of the function they are defined 
    + a single '=' defines a variable while '==' acts as equal to
    + true is treated as the number '1'
        * numbers are either truesy or falsy in js
