#Cycling commuter route assistant

##Overview 
Having commuted to work via bicycle, I learned that it positively effects your physical and mental condition every day. I believe that increasing the percentage of people who commute by bicycle can have outer reaching effects on our city, community, and environment.

##The problem
Austin's working bicycle commuting population is 1.5%. But why is that? Dangerous intersections, bike lanes designed without much continuity or thought, poorly paved roads, oddly timed lights, tough terrain, and weather. 

But Austin has a strong cycling community. While great for our city's recreational health and view as an outdoor destination, Austin's cycling community is weighted heavily towards just that, recreation. 

The city of Austin does make an attempt to improve our bicycle friendly status, but doesn't do so in a way that is thoughtful and helpful. A quick search will show that even though Austin is thought to be bike friendly, it actually falls quite short of that title. For a city so heavily drenched in "innovative tech", we are not innovating or even keeping up in simple ways to improve our city and community.

##The proposed solution
I want the cyclists in my city to feel comfortable and confident so they can commute to work or anywhere else. My idea is to create a native mobile application that uses a number of different sources to create routes that are safe, viable, and mitigate the many "roadblocks" that prevent people from commuting to work on their own power. A user will provide beginning and ending addresses and the app will calculate the shortest with appropriate bike lanes and avoiding dangerous intersections, absurd climbs, notorious roads, and seemingly stuck red lights. 

The app will allow the user to adjust their route dependent on their needs and comfort level. While we can't control the weather, I would like future iterations to have a database of showers that can be used by cyclists, and the location of good bike racks (important when riding to a new location). Crowdsourced data could have a huge impact on assisting with directions, routes, and current road issues similar to Waze' functionality. Heatmaps (unfiltered and time filtered) to show what roads are favored by riders could also provide useful information to users.

##In summary
I want everyone to share in the day to day enjoyment of riding a bicycle. The pros are so much more than the extended commute time and a little sweat, and long term benefits are huge. In addition, there is an incredible feeling when quietly, swiftly, cutting through the air on your own power.
