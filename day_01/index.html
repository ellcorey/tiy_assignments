					Laid back with an appreciation for slick design, I’m an Austin based designer with an hidden streak for thrills. I’ve done many things, but a passion for design has turned into a career – currently, I’m expanding my skill set learning UI design with <a href="http://theironyard.com/">The Iron Yard</a>!
				</p>
				<p>
					Living in Austin for over 25 years it’s a difficult task to find a better city to eat, live, and listen. I can’t pick a favorite (it’s hard as hell), but I look forward to Saturday nights when local legend, Paul Ray, plays the best in classic wax on his show, Twine Time. Couple that with an evening out at one of the best neighborhood joints around and I can’t think of something I’d rather do.
				</p>
				<p>
					My interests extend outside of Austin though. I have a huge love and hunger to travel, and have been all over the US, and ventured to Europe. I love all things German, and often spend free time often reading about some of their design greats (Dieter Rams, Otl Aicher, Hartmut Esslinger, etc.). 
				</p>
				<p>
					When not perusing for design inspiration, I enjoy spending time with my wife, Helen, our daughter, Barrett, and our 2 pups. You can often find us out playing football (soccer) or watching matches at the pub. When I’ve got some alone time, you'll likely find me out on a bicycle or motorcycle.
