##design inspirations for cae design site

###(build)[http://wearebuild.com/]
Build is a creative agency started by Michael C. Place who cut his teeth with The Designer's Republic. Simple and easy to navigate, I like the image fade when scrolling on the main page and easily accessible navigation. The site is laid out cleanly with minimal farkle to distract from their work.

###(Huncwot)[http://huncwot.com/]
Huncwot is a Polish creative agency "specializing in interaction design." They use a unique layout for for their main page divided into four with crisp interactions. The site also adapts to mobile quite well. From the left, there is a nice slide out menu that I'm fond of.

###(Studio Brave)[http://studiobrave.com.au/]
Studio Brave's site has an attractive although slightly unintuitive splash page that fades into a gorgeous black and white main profile page. The white on black text is quite a change from the stark white pages of a lot of portfolio/agency pages, but flips for the portfolio page.

###(non-plus)[http://nonpluslondon.com/]
non-plus' site is simple and effective. What is specifically of interest to me is the interaction with the menu icon and menu overlay.

###(Graphic Thought Facility)[http://www.graphicthoughtfacility.com/]
Graphic Thought Facility's site provides another menu example that I really like. It's hidden under the large image. I think this could implemented better and definitely more intuitive, but I do like it's cleanliness and organizational qualities.
